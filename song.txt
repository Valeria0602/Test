I'm a bullet from a gun and my heart is the trigger
When I was just a kid I would dream I was bigger
If you wanna make a name, better stand and deliver
'Cause there's a price we pay, every loser and winner

Oh, can't stop me now
Oh, can't stop me now
And heavy is the head that wears the crown
I'm singing, I'm singing
Oh, can't stop me now

I've climbed so many mountains, each one's another test
It's hard to breathe when it's just you against your Everest
They say what doesn't kill you will only make you stronger
Guess I can shake the world and take the pain a little longer
I'm not running from, not running from
Not running from my kryptonite and
I'll keep rising up, keep rising up

Oh, can't stop me now
Oh, can't stop me now
And heavy is the head that wears the crown
I'm singing, I'm singing
Oh, can't stop me now
And heavy is the head that wears the crown
I'm singing, I'm singing
Oh, can't stop me now
Oh, can't stop me now
give just a little smile

Ain't No Mountain High Enough
